self notes:

CryCommon is HORRENDOUS what the fuck...
Integrate VCPkg and get rid of other bink stuff

libs/CryGame - can probably add more stuff to folders e.g script, netowrk, ui i just added the stuff based on file names havent went through code yet

should RenderDll go in libs? or be renamed.... also needs better structure
