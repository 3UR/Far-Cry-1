ATI bad things in OpenGL:
1. GL_EXT_texture_rectangle extension doesn't work (though driver reports about supporting it,
   when we try to enable it we get error message invalid enum)
   --- WorkAround solution in FarCry: no solution currently. We have to disable playing of video files on ATI in OpenGL
2. OpenGL driver is much slower then Direct3D
   --- WorkAround solution in FarCry: Use Direct3D renderer only on ATI video cards
3. Fog doesn't work when we use programmable pipeline
   --- WorkAround solution in FarCry: no solution currently (Using Direct3D renderer only on ATI video cards)
